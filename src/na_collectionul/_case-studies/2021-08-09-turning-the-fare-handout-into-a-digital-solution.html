  <h2>
    Problem Overview
  </h2>
  
  <p class="ut-lead-text">
    The Ministry of Transportation created and distributed a fare handout listing all the fares in the country; Base on the background in my <a href="#">research plan</a>, users (passengers and drivers/apprentice) used the fare handout as a single source of truth to settle disputes among themselves. But the handout, in turn, causes more problems due to the following reasons:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
        Different users have different copies of the handout.
    </li>
    <li>
        The fare handout is six pages long; checking the fare from one locality to the other takes time.
    </li>
    <li>
      All the fares within the country are not captured in the handout
    </li>
    <li>
        You can't carry it all the time.
    </li>
    <li>
        30% of the passengers don't know that an official fare tariff exists from the regulators.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I want to help the Ministry by turning the six pages fare handout into a digital solution by designing an experience that allows users to check the fare from one place to another.

          Design: Concepts & Sketching
        </h3>
  
        <p>
          After completing active listening, I use a technique called affinity mapping (with miro) to gather all of the insights, cluster similar thoughts together, and named the clusters into themes. This process helps me see what exists across various users and various types of data and draw patterns to generate meaningful solutions. 
        </p>
  
        <p>
          From the themes, I have identified a few opportunity areas. For example, "How do users get updated about the fare?" has a great opportunity because there is no single source of truth of the fare handout. 
        </p>

        <p>
          After having some views, I define a user flow from start to finish, and all the different directions they can take to see the steps a user takes through to complete tasks.

        Develop: Prototyping
      </h3>

      <p>
        After defining possible user flows, I created a simple clickable prototype (using figma) based on the states of the flow to test with the users.

        Testing: Validation & Feedback 
      </h3>

      <p>
        I learned the following from the usability study: 
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>The user was confused with the two fare results page</li>
          <li>On the ALL FARES page, the user couldn't determine the fare is for which vehicle type.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
          When I conducted further usability studies, other issues also were discovered. For example, nearly 100% of the users cannot quickly check for the fare on the ALL FARES page because it takes time to scroll to find the fare they are checking up.

        Design: Iteration

      <p>
        I took the insights from the usability testing and went back to refine my designs. After a lot of iterations and testing, I came up with the following results.
